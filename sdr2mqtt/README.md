# Home Assistant Add-on: SDR2mqtt

A Home Assistant addon for a software defined radio tuned to listen for RF transmissions from SDR/RTL Sensors and republish the data via MQTT.

## Installation

Add the repository URL under **Supervisor → Add-on store → ⋮ → Manage add-on repositories**:

    https://github.com/skipnyip/skip-ha-addons

Then search for `SDR to home Assistant` and install it.

## Configuration

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
mqtt_host: 192.168.7.100
mqtt_user: mqtt_user
mqtt_password: mqtt_pass
mqtt_topic: rtl_433
mqtt_retain: 'true'
frequency: '-f 433.92M'
protocol: ''
units: 'si'
discovery_prefix: homeassistant
discovery_interval: 600
debug: false
```

### Option: `mqtt_host`

The `mqtt_host` option is the ip address of your mqtt server. If you are using the embeded server in Home Assistant just use your instances ip address.

### Option: `mqtt_user`

This is the username required to access your mqtt server.

### Option: `mqtt_password`

The password of the mqtt user account.

### Option: `mqtt_topic`

This si the topic your devices will use.

### Option: `mqtt_retain`

Setting this to `true` means the mqtt server will keep your last value 
until it is changed. Setting it to `false` means the server will forget values after a period of time, 
so you will onyl see a valus it one has been sent recently.

### Option: `frequency`

This sets the frequecy your SDR will listen for. Default is '-f 433.92M' but you could use '-f 915M' or '-f 868M'
of you could use mutliples like '-f 433.92M f 915M'  

### Option: `protocol`

This determines what devices the software listens to. `-R 11 -R 40 -R 41 -R 55 -R 74` 
is the Accurite sensors. If the protocol is blank it will listen for all devices
which may be noisy. Blank is the default with this addon. Consult the following readme for protocols. 

For all possible protocols visit <https://github.com/skipnyip/skip_ha_addons/blob/main/acurite2ha/PROTOCOLS.md>

### Option: `expire_after`

This is a `integer` value that will set an individual sensor entity to `unknown` if no payload is received within the specified seconds. The default value of 0 disables this feature.

### Option: `units`

Sets the meansurement units. 
- `si` = Metric
- `customary` = Imperial / Customary  

### Option: `discovery_prefix`

The mqtt prefix for autodiscovery. `homeassistant` should work. If you use another autodiscovery may not work.

### Option: `discovery_interval`

`600` means Home Assisatnt will check for new devices every 600 seconds. 

### Option: 'debug'

Set debug to `true` if you want to see extra logging. This is noisy though, so I would only run it when actively troubleshooting. Leave at false all other times.
